**PROJECT SUMMARY**
The goal of our project is to create a Malmo agent that learns to fight enemies using Q-learning. This agent will learn to use the optimal strategy. 

Our baseline for this project was to make a basic bot that will aim at the enemy and see if it can kill it in the basic way. A video of this is shown below.
