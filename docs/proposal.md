##Project Rambo Steve

##Summary
Project Rambo Steve aims to create an agent that can efficiently navigate through a maze while fighting enemies. The generated maze will have multiple paths to navigate through, ensuring that the agent will be able to find different paths to all enemies. Each time a mission begins, enemies will be given static spawn points that they will stay around. An enemy will only be given information within 10 blocks around it. If the enemy detects the agent, it will try to attack the agent until either the agent is killed and the mission fails, or until it is killed by the agent. For input, the agent will only be given information within 10 blocks around it. Over time, the agent will learn more about the maze and which actions yield the best path to the goal state.

##AI/ML Algorithms
This project will deploy reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning to train the agent to maximize rewards when fighting enemies and clearing the maze.

##Evaluation Plan
Quantitative Evaluation:
Our model will mainly be evaluated on mission clear time by an agent that starts by taking random actions. However, we are considering the amount of damage taken and time spent fighting enemies. We will begin our baseline on the time it takes for the agent to clear the maze for the first time. Initially, our rewards will be somewhat uniform. As we progress, rewards will change based on how the agent reacts to different reward factors. For example, we may start by giving the agent a -5 reward for each time it takes damage and a +5 reward killing enemy, but later only give it a -1 reward for damage taken and +10 reward for killing the enemy . Because we are using reinforcement learning, we will evaluate on data from previous missions and update our agentâ€™s actions accordingly. Our hope is that by using our reinforcement learning algorithms, our agent will improve by at least 50% from the base clear time.

Qualitative Evaluation:
Our performance will be measured on plots that visualize mission clear time per mission, rewards per mission and possibly mission clear time vs. time spent fighting enemies. Along with giving us data on how much our agent is improving, these plots will provide insight on how well our agent is fighting the enemies. Our sanity checks will test if our agent can at least kill a single enemy without dying and clear the maze. Our moonshot is to expand on our project by creating weaknesses for each enemy, having our agent clear the maze while killing multiple enemies attacking at once, and adding speed and slow potions to either quicken the clear time or obstruct the agent.
